# Architecture

Wiretrustee is an open source platform consisting of a collection of components, responsible for handling peer-to-peer connections, tunneling, authentication, and network management (IPs, keys, ACLs, etc).

It uses open-source technologies like [WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/), [Pion ICE (WebRTC)](https://github.com/pion/ice), [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn),
and [software](https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee) developed by Wiretrustee authors to make secure private networks deployment and management simple.

Wiretrustee relies on four components - **Clients** (or agents), **Management**, **Signal** and **Relay** services.

The combination of these elements ensures that a direct point-to-point connections are established and only authenticated users (or machines) have access to the resources for which they are authorized.

With Wiretrustee clients installed and authorized on the Management service, your machines form a mesh network connecting to each other directly via an encrypted point-to-point Wireguard tunnel.

While it is possible to create a full mesh network, it might be not a desirable outcome. In this case, ACLs can be utilized to limit the access to certain machines.
