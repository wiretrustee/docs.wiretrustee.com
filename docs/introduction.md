# Introduction

Wiretrustee is a simple and fast alternative to corporate VPNs built on top of [WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.

Wiretrustee can connect machines running anywhere in just a few clicks.

It requires near zero configuration effort leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, vpn gateways, and so forth.

:::tip open-source
Wiretrustee is an **open-source** project.

Check it out on GitHub: **[https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee](https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee)**
:::

There is no centralized VPN server with Wiretrustee - your computers, devices, machines, and servers connect to each other directly over a fast encrypted tunnel.

It literally takes less than 5 minutes to deploy a secure peer-to-peer VPN with Wiretrustee. Check our [Getting Started Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWTsGUJAUaU) on YouTube.
